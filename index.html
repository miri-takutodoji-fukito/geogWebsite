      <p>
        Tengah is Singapore's newest HDB town in two decades, built around
        <span>five “green” districts</span> that blend
        <span>nature, sustainability, and community</span>. 3,800 families,
        representing both <span>younger and older residents</span>, have already
        moved into the Plantation District since last year. As Tengah
        <span>encourages its residents to live green</span>, the community
        gardens play a pivotal role in
        <span>encouraging residents to come together</span> and learn about the
        importance of sustainable food production. Given the experiences with
        other HDB estates, community gardens tend to be utilised only by elderly
        residents and/or a small group of gardening enthusiasts. HDB hopes that
        as Geography students, you can
        <span>provide possible ideas to encourage greater involvement</span>
        from <span>residents of all ages</span> in Tengah to develop
        <span>greater community spirit</span> and live up to Tengah's ideals of
        green living.

      <p>
        We plan to introduce workshops much like the Community in Bloom(CIB)
        project. We can have something along the lines of the Live Well, Age
        Well Programme.

      <h2 class="title">Community Events & Farmer Markets</h2>
      <p>
        Regularly scheduled events can draw more visitors and participants.
        Farmers' Markets can also be where residents can sell or exchange crops,
        building a small economy around the gardens. Lastly, cooking
        demonstrations can feature chefs who teach residents how to use their
        homegrown ingredients to make dishes.
