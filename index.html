      <p>
        Tengah is Singapore's newest HDB town in two decades, built around
        <span>five “green” districts</span> that blend
        <span>nature, sustainability, and community</span>. 3,800 families,
        representing both <span>younger and older residents</span>, have already
        moved into the Plantation District since last year. As Tengah
        <span>encourages its residents to live green</span>, the community
        gardens play a pivotal role in
        <span>encouraging residents to come together</span> and learn about the
        importance of sustainable food production. Given the experiences with
        other HDB estates, community gardens tend to be utilised only by elderly
        residents and/or a small group of gardening enthusiasts. HDB hopes that
        as Geography students, you can
        <span>provide possible ideas to encourage greater involvement</span>
        from <span>residents of all ages</span> in Tengah to develop
        <span>greater community spirit</span> and live up to Tengah's ideals of
        green living.

      <p>
        Other than just because of the <span>Tengah Town Plan</span> to become a
        blend of urbanisation and it's residents, these gardens not only
        <span>connect people with nature</span> but it also
        <span>connects people with each other</span>, and even connecting them
        with their health; examples like better air quality and a
        <span>better biodiversity in their neighbourhood</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connecting everyone in the community can
        <span>encourage more interactions</span> and foster a
        <span>sense of belonging and bonding</span>, helping each other find
        like minded individuals and

        even <span>expanding social networks</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These gardens are also a way to
        <span>improve mental health by relieving stress</span> for people who
        enjoy doing what they do as a hobby and even people who admire what the

        <span>often organised by the local authorities</span> such as the

        Some of these spaces also <span>focus on food production</span>, while

      </h2>
      <p>
        Ever since Singapore faced supply chain disruptions caused by Covid 19,
        <span>Singapore has introduced its 30 by 30 plans</span> which include
        <span>producing 30% of food demands locally by 2030</span>, from
        vegetable, egg and fish farms to even
        <span>alternative proteins like plant-based meats</span>. This is of
        course, only
        <span>one of Singapores three sources of food security</span>, the other
        two being
        <span
          >imported food and overseas farmed crops being exported to
          Singapore</span
        >. With all that,

          >community gardening is seen as a possible fourth basket to food
          security</span
        >
        and a step to the 30 by 30 goal. 86 percent of leafy vegetable demands
        are made up from imports, while
        <span

          spaces</span
        >. Up to 661 hectares of land can be amassed from all of the HDB roofs
        according to an earlier study. With all this, there still stands

        What are some of the possible disadvantages of these Gardens?
      </h2>
      <p>
        While the advantages of a community garden as one of Singapore's pillars
        to food security, <span>there are some disadvantages</span>. To many
        crop farmers especially
        <span>insects are a big issue to the vitality of planted crops</span>,
        which can be solved with some nets and bags. However, community gardens
        being shared spaces, <span>become a place of thievery</span>; gardeners
        spend all their time on this niche hobby,
        <span
          >sometimes attempting to plant certain crops that arent commonly
          known</span
        >
        to be easy to plant. Since these places are open to the public, there
        are <span>bound to be people who walk by</span> and admire these crops,
        <span>pluck some home and some cases even take the entire plant</span>
        with them. This <span>breaks the community spirit</span> and even
        <span>reduce the group of community gardeners</span> as it may be
        frustrating for many, this can
        <span>greatly effect Singapore's food resilience</span> if community
        gardens were to become fourth basket for Singapore's food security.

      <h2 class="title">Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        With all these plans, there comes some limitations faced by community
        gardens in Singapore. <span>One of the biggest problems</span> is
        <span>land constraints</span>. Space in Singapore is one of the biggest
        challenges in all aspects due to the
        <span
          >country's limited space that restricts the number of and size</span
        >
        of these community gardens being build or allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintenance challenges also arise as
        <span>gardening requires regular upkeep</span> such as
        <span>constant monitoring for pests</span> and in a more commonly known
        issue, dengue outbreaks in the community. There may also be
        <span>inadequate water supplies, poor soil quality</span> and even the
        <span>lack of funding for tools</span> required. There also comes apoint
        where <span>community engagement in community gardens are low</span>,
        which leads to <span>underutilised spaces</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overseas, community gardens serve various
        <span>purposes depending on local needs</span>. The United Kingdom
        emphasizes sustainability, biodiversity, and mental well-being,
        <span>integrating gardens into housing estates</span> and public spaces.
        Australia incorporates community gardens into parks,
        <span>promoting permaculture and native plant conservation</span>. In
        Japan, <span>rooftop and vertical gardens</span> help
        <span>maximize limited urban space</span> while mitigating the urban
        heat effect. Meanwhile, the Netherlands focuses on environmental
        education and <span>innovative urban farming techniques</span>,
        integrating gardens into city planning.

    <div class="contentbox text">
      <h2 class="title">Good Practices</h2>
      <p>
        Other <span>successful community gardens</span> have come up in
        Singapore and overseas such as
        <span>Serangoon North community garden</span> or Wasatch Community
        garden in America. Both of them
        <span>showcase the ability for community gardens</span> to
        <span>bring a community together</span>. In Singapore, they practice
        mentorship. Here they ensure that newer or older members get information
        they need to help them to learn more about community gardening. Together
        with that, they also <span>practice the use of technology</span> in
        their gardening. This allows them to <span>be up to date</span> with
        what is used currently. As for America, they practice
        <span>meetings and give resources to the people</span>. These practices
        allow for the
        <span>barrier of money and communication to not be the limiting</span>
        factors.

      <h2 class="title">Community Spirit Potential</h2>
      <p>
        There is <span>much of an issue</span> in trying to
        <span>bring back community spirits</span> among residents of
        <span
          >different estates as there are newer mixes of different people</span
        >
        who need to be <span>engaged in multiple ways</span>. Residents
        <span>do not look forward to wanting to volunteer</span> in helping the
        community as it
        <span>do not look forward to wanting to volunteer</span>. In general,
        the need to <span>find new ways to foster a lively community</span> is
        as big as the need to adapt to the <span>changing society</span> by
        finding new ways to
        <span
          >bring people of like minds from different communities together</span
        >, and bringing each different group from different communities to
        <span>form a new community</span>, in hopes that we can all
        <span>relive the 1960s</span> again.

      <h2 class="title">Solution:</h2>
      <h2 class="title">Community Events & Farmer Markets</h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, <span>we intend enhance community gardening</span> by
        <span>organizing farmers' markets</span> to attract visitors and allow
        residents to <span>sell or trade crops</span>, fostering a
        <span>small local economy</span>. By supporting local produce, we also
        <span>boost Singapore's food security</span>. (Singapore Food Agency.
        ,n.d.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, <span>weekly cooking demonstrations</span> by chefs can
        <span>teach residents how to use homegrown ingredients</span>.
        Additionally, partnering
        <span>with NParks and the town council</span> can provide resources like
        tools and expertise through talks. Joining the
        <span>Community in Bloom program</span> offers
        <span>guidance on garden design</span>, management, and site selection
        while supporting gardeners through
        <span
          >educational resources, competitions, and ambassador initiatives</span
        >. We could also implement a program
        <span>similar to Live Well, Age Well</span> to further engage the
        community. The implementation of these ideas will
        <span>allow for a close knit community</span> to be built through
        <span>community engagement</span> in activities such as:
      </p>
      <p>- Talks by stakeholders like NParks</p>

      <h2 class="title">Impact</h2>
      <p>
        Our proposed solutions will have an
        <span>impact on the residents in Tengah</span>, especially the ones who
        are <span>not that well versed in gardening</span>. Here, they will
        <span>be able to learn</span>, understand, and
        <span>develop a passion for gardening</span> as well as
        <span>familiarise themselves</span> with the community. This will help
        the <span>community to be close knit and strong.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our proposed solutions
        <span>community to be close knit and strong</span> to all over Singapore
        if popular. Residents from other neighbourhoods
        <span>may find these ideas interesting</span> or see their results and
        may want to implement it too. From here, Singapore will be able to
        <span>foster tight knit communities all over</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possibility is that
        <span>Singapore's food security will improve</span>. The
        <span> increase in community gardening</span> will allow for more
        <span> self sufficiency </span> in Singapore and more knowledge in the
        field of gardening. Singapore will be able to
        <span>hit its 30 by 30 plan</span>. Our
        <span>leafy vegetable local production will be able to increase</span>
        from the current 14%. (Singapore Food Agency, n.d).

        The farmers' markets should be done in the first week of every 2 months.
        It will last for a week so people have enough time to choose and buy the
        items that they want.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other idea is to have cooking shows and talks. These will be held
        every other month on the first Saturday of the month as most people will
        be free to join the show, allowing us to amass a larger audience. We
        would prefer to have the show every Saturday but it may not be feasible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would prefer to partner with organisations like Community In Bloom
        and Nparks as fast as possible (within the first week)in order to get
        funding and manpower for our events and activities. We are not able to
        start events like the farmer's market without the support of the
        organisations due to lack of funding and manpower.
