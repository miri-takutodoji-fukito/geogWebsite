      <p>
        Tengah is Singapore's newest HDB town in two decades, built around
        <span>five “green” districts</span> that blend
        <span>nature, sustainability, and community</span>. 3,800 families,
        representing both <span>younger and older residents</span>, have already
        moved into the Plantation District since last year. As Tengah
        <span>encourages its residents to live green</span>, the community
        gardens play a pivotal role in
        <span>encouraging residents to come together</span> and learn about the
        importance of sustainable food production. Given the experiences with
        other HDB estates, community gardens tend to be utilised only by elderly
        residents and/or a small group of gardening enthusiasts. HDB hopes that
        as Geography students, you can
        <span>provide possible ideas to encourage greater involvement</span>
        from <span>residents of all ages</span> in Tengah to develop
        <span>greater community spirit</span> and live up to Tengah's ideals of
        green living.

      <h2 class="title">Why Focus On Commnuity Gardens?</h2>
      <p>
        Other than just because of the <span>Tengah Town Plan</span> to become a
        blend of urbanisation and it's residents, these gardens not only
        <span>connect people with nature</span> but it also
        <span>connects people with each other</span>, and even connecting them
        with their health; examples like better air quality and a
        <span>better biodiversity in their neighbourhood</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connecting everyone in the community can
        <span>encourage more interactions</span> and foster a
        <span>sense of belonging and bonding</span>, helping each other find
        like minded individuals and
        <span>knowing each other better through common interests</span>, and
        even <span>expanding social networks</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These gardens are also a way to
        <span>improve mental health by relieving stress</span> for people who
        enjoy doing what they do as a hobby and even people who admire what the
        community has made. Gardening encourages
        <span>outdoor activity for a better well-being</span>.

    </div>
    <div class="contentbox text">
      <h2 class="title">What & Where Are These Gardens?</h2>
      <p>
        These community gardens are <span>shared spaces allocated</span> in HDB
        estate parks, carpark roofs and even schools under the
        <span>Community in Bloom CIB program by NParks</span>. These spaces are
        residents' <span>go-to place</span> if they like to grow plants, flowers
        and even vegetables. These spaces are
        <span>often organised by the local authorities</span> such as the
        <span>Regional Committee RC</span> or even groups and organisations.
        Some of these spaces also <span>focus on food production</span>, while
        others emphasize nature appreciation, education and wellness.

        What are some of the possible benefits of these Gardens?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Ever since Singapore faced supply chain disruptions caused by Covid 19,
        <span>Singapore has introduced its 30 by 30 plans</span> which include
        <span>producing 30% of food demands locally by 2030</span>, from
        vegetable, egg and fish farms to even
        <span>alternative proteins like plant-based meats</span>. This is of
        course, only
        <span>one of Singapores three sources of food security</span>, the other
        two being
        <span
          >imported food and overseas farmed crops being exported to
          Singapore</span
        >. With all that,
        <span
          >community gardening is seen as a possible fourth basket to food
          security</span
        >
        and a step to the 30 by 30 goal. 86 percent of leafy vegetable demands
        are made up from imports, while
        <span
          >local production and overseas exports make up the remaining 14
          percent</span
        >. A <span>boost is foreseen</span> in Singapore's food resilience
        <span
          >by significantly increasing the number of local productions in unused
          spaces</span
        >. Up to 661 hectares of land can be amassed from all of the HDB roofs
        according to an earlier study. With all this, there still stands
        <span
          >a line of defence from the possible fourth basket of food
          security</span
        >
        from our community gardens

        What are some of the possible disadvantages of these Gardens?
      </h2>
      <p>
        While the advantages of a community garden as one of Singapore's pillars
        to food security, <span>there are some disadvantages</span>. To many
        crop farmers especially
        <span>insects are a big issue to the vitality of planted crops</span>,
        which can be solved with some nets and bags. However, community gardens
        being shared spaces, <span>become a place of thievery</span>; gardeners
        spend all their time on this niche hobby,
        <span
          >sometimes attempting to plant certain crops that arent commonly
          known</span
        >
        to be easy to plant. Since these places are open to the public, there
        are <span>bound to be people who walk by</span> and admire these crops,
        <span>pluck some home and some cases even take the entire plant</span>
        with them. This <span>breaks the community spirit</span> and even
        <span>reduce the group of community gardeners</span> as it may be
        frustrating for many, this can
        <span>greatly effect Singapore's food resilience</span> if community
        gardens were to become fourth basket for Singapore's food security.

      <h2 class="title">Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        With all these plans, there comes some limitations faced by community
        gardens in Singapore. <span>One of the biggest problems</span> is land
        constraints. Space in Singapore is one of the biggest challenges in all
        aspects due to the country's limited space that restricts the number of
        and size of these community gardens being build or allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintenance challenges also arise as gardening requires regular upkeep
        such as constant monitoring for pests and in a more commonly known
        issue, dengue outbreaks in the community. There may also be inadequate
        water supplies, poor soil quality and even the lack of funding for tools
        required. There also comes apoint where community engagement in
        community gardens are low, which leads to underutilised spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overseas, community gardens serve various purposes depending on local
        needs. The United Kingdom emphasizes sustainability, biodiversity, and
        mental well-being, integrating gardens into housing estates and public
        spaces. Australia incorporates community gardens into parks, promoting
        permaculture and native plant conservation. In Japan, rooftop and
        vertical gardens help maximize limited urban space while mitigating the
        urban heat effect. Meanwhile, the Netherlands focuses on environmental
        education and innovative urban farming techniques, integrating gardens
        into city planning.

      <h2 class="title">Community Spirit Potential</h2>
      <p>
        There is much of an issue in trying to bring back community spirits
        among residents of different estates as there are newer mixes of
        different people who need to be engaged in multiple ways. Residents do
        not look forward to wanting to volunteer in helping the community as it
        usually turns off many residents. In general, the need to find new ways
        to foster a lively community is as big as the need to adapt to the
        changing society by finding new ways to bring people of like minds from
        different communities together, and bringing each different group from
        different communities to form a new community, in hopes that we can all
        relive the 1960s again
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentbox text solution">
      <h2 class="title">Solution:</h2>
      <h2 class="title">Community Events & Farmer Markets</h2>
      <p>
        Firstly, <span>we intend enhance community gardening</span> by
        <span>organizing farmers' markets</span> to attract visitors and allow
        residents to <span>sell or trade crops</span>, fostering a
        <span>small local economy</span>. By supporting local produce, we also
        <span>boost Singapore's food security</span>. (Singapore Food Agency.
        ,n.d.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, <span>weekly cooking demonstrations</span> by chefs can
        <span>teach residents how to use homegrown ingredients</span>.
        Additionally, partnering
        <span>with NParks and the town council</span> can provide resources like
        tools and expertise. Joining the
        <span>Community in Bloom program</span> offers
        <span>guidance on garden design</span>, management, and site selection
        while supporting gardeners through
        <span
          >educational resources, competitions, and ambassador initiatives</span
        >. We could also implement a program
        <span>similar to Live Well, Age Well</span> to further engage the
        community. The implementation of these ideas will
        <span>allow for a close knit community</span> to be built through
        <span>community engagement</span> in activities.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>
        We suggest a plan that starts off with
        <span>farmers' markets</span>
        to draw visitors and participants. These farmers' markets are places
        where <span>residents can sell and exchange crops</span> with each
        other,
        <span>building a small economy around the community gardens</span>. This
        all follows with cooking demonstrations where chefs
        <span
          >showcase how to use these homegrown ingredients can be made into
          spectacular dishes</span
        >. These markets will be planned on <span>a weekly basis</span>. Other
        than just these events, collaborations with NParks and the Town Council
        would be to <span>support the community with tools</span> and even
        collaborations to help
        <span>expand the Community In Bloom programme.</span>
