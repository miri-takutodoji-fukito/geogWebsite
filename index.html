      <p>
        Tengah is Singapore's newest HDB town in two decades, built around
        <span>five “green” districts</span> that blend
        <span>nature, sustainability, and community</span>. 3,800 families,
        representing both <span>younger and older residents</span>, have already
        moved into the Plantation District since last year. As Tengah
        <span>encourages its residents to live green</span>, the community
        gardens play a pivotal role in
        <span>encouraging residents to come together</span> and learn about the
        importance of sustainable food production. Given the experiences with
        other HDB estates, community gardens tend to be utilised only by elderly
        residents and/or a small group of gardening enthusiasts. HDB hopes that
        as Geography students, you can
        <span>provide possible ideas to encourage greater involvement</span>
        from <span>residents of all ages</span> in Tengah to develop
        <span>greater community spirit</span> and live up to Tengah's ideals of
        green living.

        <span>Regularly scheduled events</span> can draw more visitors and
        participants. Farmers' Markets can also be where
        <span>residents can sell or exchange crops</span>, building a small
        economy around the gardens. Lastly,
        <span>cooking demonstrations</span> can feature chefs who teach
        residents how to use their

      <h2 class="title">Why Focus On Commnuity Gardens?</h2>
      <p>
        Other than just because of the <span>Tengah Town Plan</span> to become a
        blend of urbanisation and it's residents, these gardens not only
        <span>connect people with nature</span> but it also
        <span>connects people with each other</span>, and even connecting them
        with their health; examples like better air quality and a
        <span>better biodiversity in their neighbourhood</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Connecting everyone in the community can
        <span>encourage more interactions</span> and foster a
        <span>sense of belonging and bonding</span>, helping each other find
        like minded individuals and
        <span>knowing each other better through common interests</span>, and
        even <span>expanding social networks</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        These gardens are also a way to
        <span>improve mental health by relieving stress</span> for people who
        enjoy doing what they do as a hobby and even people who admire what the
        community has made. Gardening encourages
        <span>outdoor activity for a better well-being</span>.

      <h2 class="title">What & Where Are These Gardens?</h2>
      <p>
        These community gardens are <span>shared spaces allocated</span> in HDB
        estate parks, carpark roofs and even schools under the
        <span>Community in Bloom CIB program by NParks</span>. These spaces are
        residents' <span>go-to place</span> if they like to grow plants, flowers
        and even vegetables. These spaces are
        <span>often organised by the local authorities</span> such as the
        <span>Regional Committee RC</span> or even groups and organisations.
        Some of these spaces also <span>focus on food production</span>, while
        others emphasize nature appreciation, education and wellness.
